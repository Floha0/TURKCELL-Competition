=== CFM56-7B TECHNICAL MAINTENANCE MANUAL ===
SECTION: TROUBLESHOOTING & FAULT ISOLATION

[FAULT CODE: HPC-STALL-01]
SYMPTOM: Abnormal rise in Sensor 11 (Static Pressure) and Sensor 4 (EGT).
ROOT CAUSE: High Pressure Compressor (HPC) Stall due to airflow disruption.
IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Retard throttle to IDLE immediately.
2. Turn on Continuous Ignition.
3. Monitor EGT (Exhaust Gas Temp). If EGT exceeds 950C, initiate Engine Shutdown.
MAINTENANCE ACTION:
1. Perform Borescope Inspection of HPC Stages 1-9. Look for nicks or bent blades.
2. Inspect Variable Bleed Valves (VBV) for blockage.
3. Check VSV (Variable Stator Vanes) rigging angles.

[FAULT CODE: LPT-VIB-09]
SYMPTOM: High vibration in Sensor 20 or Sensor 21.
ROOT CAUSE: Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) blade imbalance or bearing wear.
IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Reduce thrust to 50% N1.
2. Monitor vibration levels.
MAINTENANCE ACTION:
1. Inspect LPT blades for shingling.
2. Check No. 4 and No. 5 Bearing oil scavenge filters for metal chips.

[FAULT CODE: FUEL-FLOW-HIGH]
SYMPTOM: Divergence in Fuel Flow (Sensor 13) vs N2 Speed.
ROOT CAUSE: Fuel Nozzle clogging or HMU (Hydromechanical Unit) internal leak.
ACTION:
1. Replace Fuel Nozzles.
2. Perform Leak Check on HMU.

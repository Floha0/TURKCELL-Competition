    A CRITICAL FAILURE (Priority 4) has been detected in Engine Unit #1.
    
    INPUT DATA:
    - Statistical Anomaly Score (MSE): {loss_score} (Threshold exceeded!)
    - Real-time Telemetry Snapshot: {sensor_data}
    
    Your mission is to perform a Root Cause Analysis (RCA):
    1. Identify specifically which sensors are deviating from nominal ranges.
    2. Analyze the correlation between deviating sensors (e.g., T24 vs W24).
    3. Determine the physical failure mode (e.g., High Pressure Compressor Stall, Turbine Blade Creep, Bearing Failure).
    4. Assess the severity of the failure based on the deviation magnitude.
  expected_output: >
    A structured technical report containing:
    - [Violating Sensors]: List of specific sensors with abnormal readings.
    - [Failure Mode]: The specific mechanical/thermal issue identified.
    - [Technical Reasoning]: A concise explanation of why this failure occurred based on the data.

action_plan_task:
  description: >
    Review the Technical Diagnosis Report provided by the Senior Engineer.
    Based on the identified failure mode, generate a critical response plan.
    
    You must provide:
    1. IN-FLIGHT EMERGENCY ACTIONS: Immediate steps for the pilot (e.g., Idle Throttle, Engage Fire Suppression).
    2. GROUND MAINTENANCE ORDERS: Specific repair actions for the hangar crew (e.g., Borescope inspection of Stage 4, Replace Fuel Nozzle).
  expected_output: >
    A strictly formatted SAFETY & ACTION REPORT:
    - **EMERGENCY PROTOCOL**: 3 clear, imperative commands for immediate execution.
    - **MAINTENANCE TICKET**: The required inspection or replacement procedure.

    A CRITICAL FAILURE (Priority 4) has been detected in Engine Unit #1.
    
    INPUT DATA:
    - Statistical Anomaly Score (MSE): {loss_score} (Threshold exceeded!)
    - Real-time Telemetry Snapshot: {sensor_data}
    
    Your mission is to perform a Comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA):
    1. **Data Forensics:** Identify specifically which sensors are deviating. Use your calculation tools to quantify the deviation magnitude.
    2. **Correlation Analysis:** Analyze the correlation between deviating sensors (e.g., How does T24 affect W24?). Explain the thermodynamic link.
    3. **Failure Mode Determination:** Determine the specific physical failure mode (e.g., High Pressure Compressor Stall, Turbine Blade Creep, Bearing Failure) with high confidence.
    4. **Severity Assessment:** Assess the immediate risk to the aircraft based on the RUL and Deviation.
    
    **Constraint:** Your report must be detailed, technical, and at least 3 paragraphs long.
  expected_output: >
    A structured, detailed Technical Analysis Report containing:
    - [Violating Sensors & Metrics]: Detailed list with calculated deviations.
    - [Thermodynamic Analysis]: Explanation of the engine cycle disruption.
    - [Definitive Root Cause]: The specific mechanical/thermal issue identified.
    - [Risk Assessment]: Quantitative assessment of the failure severity.

  description: >
    Review the Technical Diagnosis Report provided by the Senior Engineer.
    Based on the identified failure mode, generate a comprehensive Critical Response Protocol.
    
    You must provide:
    1. **IN-FLIGHT EMERGENCY ACTIONS (QRH):** Detailed steps for the pilot. Explain exactly what switch to flip and why (e.g., "Retard Throttle to IDLE to lower T4 temperatures").
    2. **GROUND MAINTENANCE ORDERS (AMM):** Specific repair actions for the hangar crew. Include part names, inspection methods (Borescope, NDT), and safety warnings.
    3. **POST-INCIDENT PROCEDURE:** What logs need to be pulled and where the engine should be sent.
    
    **Constraint:** Use imperative military-style language but provide detailed context for every order.
  expected_output: >
    A strictly formatted, detailed SAFETY & ACTION DOSSIER:
    - **EMERGENCY FLIGHT PROTOCOL**: Step-by-step pilot instructions with rationale.
    - **GROUND MAINTENANCE TICKET**: Detailed work order for the engineering team including tooling required.
    - **SAFETY WARNINGS**: Critical hazards to personnel (e.g., High Pressure, Heat).
